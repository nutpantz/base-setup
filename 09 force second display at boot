editing configuration files like /etc/default/grub and regenerating the GRUB configuration.
 
 video=HDMI-1:1360x768:D video=HDMI-2:1920x1080:D
 
 force the HDMI-1 output to be always enabled (the :D letter at the end does that), and to always use a particular resolution that was suited to my display;

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="ipv6.disable=1 quiet video=HDMI-1:me video1920x1080=HDMI-2:1920x1080me"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="ipv6.disable=1 video=HDMI-1:1920x1080me video=HDMI-2:1920x1080me"

Run sudo update-grub to apply the changes.


DRM drivers also add options to enable or disable outputs:

'e' will force the display to be enabled, i.e. it will override the detection
if a display is connected. 'D' will force the display to be enabled and use
digital output. This is useful for outputs that have both analog and digital
signals (e.g. HDMI and DVI-I). For other outputs it behaves like 'e'. If 'd'
is specified the output is disabled.

You can additionally specify which output the options matches to.
To force the VGA output to be enabled and drive a specific mode say::

    video=VGA-1:1280x1024@60me

Specifying the option multiple times for different ports is possible, e.g.::

    video=LVDS-1:d video=HDMI-1:D

Options can also be passed after the mode, using commas as separator.

       Sample usage: 720x480,rotate=180 - 720x480 mode, rotated by 180 degrees
