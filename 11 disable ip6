Method 1: Disable the IPv6 on Debian 12 Using the sysctl Configuration

The first method of disabling the IPv6 on Debian 12 is by making the changes in the systctl configuration by the below-mentioned steps. 

Step 1: Display the Current Status of IPv6

To find out the current status of the IPv6, run the command:
$ sudo sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6

The “0” displaying the IPv6 is enabled. 

Step 2: Open the sysctl Configuration File

Open the sysctl configuration file with the help of the text editor, in our case, the nano text editor is being used to open the file:
$ sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

Step 3: Edit the sysctl Configuration File

Scroll down the file and copy-paste the below-mentioned lines at the end of the file to disable the IPv6 permanently:
# Disabling the IPv6
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1

Save the changes with the CTRL+S and exit the nano text editor. 

 sudo update-initramfs -u
 
 check with 
  sudo sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6
  
  should report
  
  1
  
  and
  ip a | grep inet6
  should report nothing

Method 2: Disable the IPv6 on Debian 12 by Blacklisting its Kernel Module

Another method of disabling the IPv6 on Debian 12 is by blacklisting the IPv6 Kernel Module following the below-mentioned steps.

Step 1: Open the Blacklist Configuration File

First, open the Blacklisting configuration file using the nano text editor:
$ sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-ipv6.conf

Step 2: Edit the Blacklist Configuration File

Blacklist the IPv6 Kernel module so it will not load and this can be done by adding the below-mentioned line in the blacklisting file:
blacklist ipv6

Step 3: Apply the Changes

Now apply the changes made in the blacklisting configuration file by running the command:
$ sudo update-initramfs -u

sudo reboot
Step 5: Verify the Changes

To verify the changes in the blacklist configuration file, run the command:
$ lsmod | grep ipv6
